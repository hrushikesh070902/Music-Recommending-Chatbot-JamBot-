# Music-Recommending-Chatbot-JamBot-
JamBot is a web app that chats with the user and on the basis of the chats, the emotion(mood) of the user will be detected using IBM Tone Analyzer, and it will be displayed on the screen. According to the emotions of the user, the Bot will recommend songs using Last.fm API.

# About:-
Music is one of the best thing that has been developed over the years. Most of the music apps has an algorithm that recommends songs to the user on the basis of their previous searches. But the mood of the user changes from time to time. So to overcome this problem, we have created a Music Chatbot that suggests songs according to the mood of the user rather than their songs history.

# Objectives:-
- Making a chatbot capable of chatting better than compared to humans.
